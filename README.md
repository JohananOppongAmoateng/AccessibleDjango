# AccessibleDjango 🌟

AccessibleDjango is a Django package focused on checking your web applications for accessibility compliance. It ensures your app adheres to accessibility standards, making your web interfaces usable for everyone, including individuals with disabilities. AccessibleDjango currently checks for missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags, with plans for further accessibility features in future releases.

  Automatically evaluates views and templates for common accessibility issues, such as missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags.  

- **Detailed Reports**:  
  Generates comprehensive accessibility reports highlighting issues found in your templates and views.  

- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:

- Missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags.  
- Poor color contrast.  
- Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes.  
- Improper heading structure.  
- Missing labels for form inputs.  

Run the command to generate a report:  
```bash  
python manage.py check_accessibility --output=report.json  
```
